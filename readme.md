Functionality:

Users selects a photo (URL) that they would want more details of and the app will return as many features about the photo they could find. An extra feature would be to have the option to upload a file live and get a response.

Features:

User will select a type of log in when they come to the app. A feature would be to have log ins for different purposes, such as, inspiration, educational, personal, lifestyle, etc... These will be the collections available to them to save the photos they've searched for. If able to implement Instagram API into project, the main page will display a list of trending photos based on 'current location', acquired by the google API. Otherwise, main page will render blocks of the different collections they can choose from to save their photos. Users can add/remove photos from their collection as they please. If it's a one time search, photo will not be saved once a new search is initiated.
