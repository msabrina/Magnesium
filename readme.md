Visual Recognition IBM Watson API

## Functionality:

Users selects a photo (URL) that they would want more details of and the app will return as many features about the photo they could find. An extra feature would be to have the option to upload a file live and get a response.

## Features:

Option to Sign Up or Log In. There will be collections available for users to save the photos they've searched for under their profile. Main feature is the ability to submit any URL into the search box and send it to Watson to analyze. In user's profile, there is an option for a user to interact with random images acquired from Unsplash API. Users can add/remove photos from their saved collections as they please. If it's a one time search, photo will not be saved once a new search is initiated. If able to implement Instagram API into project, the main page will display a list of trending photos based on 'current location', acquired by the Google Map API.
